Template Customer Repo

====

This is a Scala sample project. It will consist of:

* one newly created Play project with a start page, application/form page and a summary page
* tests
* Twitter Bootstrap


The point of this application is to show how to quickly setup a simple Play application which uses Git with GitHub to store it's code

Web framework
-------------
I am using [Play framework](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/Home) because:

* It is a framework I have used for Vehicles Online at the DVLA.

Twitter Bootstrap
-------------
I am using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://www.http://getbootstrap.com/) because:

* Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

Version control
---------------

I am using Git with Github because:

* I am familiar with Github from using it on several projects.
* I prefer using Git for version control as it works well with TDD's short iterations of coding.
